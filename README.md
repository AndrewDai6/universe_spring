# universe_spring

This project contains a Spring Web Application that manages a PostgreSQL Database of Celestial Bodies.

At the moment, handlers exist for Planets and Moons.

The Database url, user name, and password are set within the enviromental variables.

I tested the application by using Postman to send http requests for the application to handle.
